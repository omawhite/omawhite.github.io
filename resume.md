## Roles

**Technology Leadership Program Software Engineer, Target Corporation (July 2017 - Present )**

* As a TLP I will be working to use technology to help Target solve their business needs while also improving my skills as an engineer. Target employs numerous different technologies across its business areas, many of which are open source, I will be becoming familiar with a few of them in my time as a TLP.

**Team Lead, Serve IT Non-Profit Clinic (August 2016 - May 2017)**

* I served as the team lead for the Development & Maintenance team for the Serve IT clinic. Our team was tasked with the on-going support and maintenance of previously developed projects in the clinic, as well as finishing up lingering projects left behind by previous teams. As a team lead I was tasked with major development and administrative responsibilities. On the development side I served as one of the lead developers on the team, using my experience to push forward on more challenging tasks. I also served in a mentoring capacity, especially for my underclassmen interns, trying to impart my experience upon them through group work sessions as well as by pointing the in the direction of resources they could explore on their own. On the administrative side I was tasked with keeping in regular contact with multiple clients to discuss the long term status of their projects. I also conducted performance reviews with all of my interns twice a semester. Additionally at the end of each semester I led the push to write appropriate documentation and end of the semester reports about the status of our work in order to make it easier for future teams to pick up where we left off.

**Systems Intern, Cerner Corporation (May 2016 - July 2016)**

* As a systems intern I engaged in a combination of front end and backend server work, on Unix and Windows based systems. Daily tasks included administering updates, managing and creating accounts as well as permissions for said accounts, configuration of network printers, and general troubleshooting. I also assisted full time systems engineers in the completion of projects for clients.

**Software Development Intern, Serve IT Non-Profit Clinic (January 2016 - May 2016)**

* As a software developer for the Serve IT clinic I worked with a team of other developers, as well as business analysts, designers, and various other roles to create a time tracking application using Python and Django for a local Non-Profit organization. We utilized agile development methods and met regularly with the client to demonstrate the application and get feed back for future iterations of the project.

**Undergraduate Research Assistant, University of Alabama (May 2015 - July 2015)**

* I took part in the [DREU](http://cra.org/cra-w/dreu/) program during the summer of 2015 which paired me up with [Dr. Monica Anderson](http://eng.ua.edu/people/manderson/), a tenure professor at the University of Alabama. Together with a team of two electrical engineers and the help of Dr. Anderson we set out to build an environmental sensor system using Arduinos and low cost components.
