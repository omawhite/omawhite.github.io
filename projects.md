### [STM32 Brick Breaker](https://github.com/omawhite/Brick-Breaker)
At the end of my Junior year as part of the Computer Structures class a partner and I were tasked with building a game to run on the STM32 board in C. We chose to build a version of the popular game Brick-Breaker. Check it out [here](https://github.com/omawhite/Brick-Breaker).
