## Working title

Once upon a (not so long ago) time I was college senior trying to finish up my capstone project. To fufill this requirement I became a team lead at the School of Informatics and Computing's(The engineering part hadn't yet been added to the title) non-profit clinic Serve IT. 

At Serve IT we used skills we learned in the classroom to build websites and applications for local non-profits in the Bloomington, IN area. The majority of the projects we had were websites built with Wordpress, but during my time with the clinic I had the pleasure(and pain) of being on one of the projects that were a bit more complicated. One of our clients needed more than just a website, they wanted an entire database that could track their volunteers, among other things. They had lots of ambitious ideas of where the project could go, but to start we were to build an application that could just track volunteer hours. 

This project became notorious amongst the clinic because of the ammount of time it dragged on, a record 4 semesters! I was attached to this project for 3 of these semesters, 2 of which I was a team lead. For the first two semesters the main challenge of the project was the coding of the application and while I learned alot during this process today I would like to talk a bit about the last two semesters I spent with this project which focused on deployment.
