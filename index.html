<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>
  Congratulations you've stumbled upon my portfolio site. For a long time I've wanted to be able to have a space to display projects, blog a bit, and generally just have a little bit of a web presence. After stumbling upon jekyll and github pages I was able to make this little site a reality. If you're looking to create your own site and are already familiar with github I highly recommend checking out jekyll and github pages!
