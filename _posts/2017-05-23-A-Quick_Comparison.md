In my last post I talked about how a redesigned my site, but didn't provide any photos as a comparison. So I wanted to do that quickly here.
<div class="space-extra-small"></div>
![a photo of the old site]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/oldsite.png)
Here we have the home page of the old site.
<div class="space-extra-small"></div>
![photo of the new site]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/newsite.png)
And here we have an image of what we've got now.
<div class="space-extra-small"></div>

Like I said before I quickly became tired of the old layout, even though it has things I will miss, mainly it's projects page layout. For the most part I'm happy with this design and now that this is out of the way I hope to get to work on a few other projects I've had in my backlog. Once I have more things done that are worth while expect me to write about them here.
