After a long hiatus I'm finally able to get back to working on this site. Being on winter break is truly a blessing for productivity and creativity. I love not being forced to work on school work and instead being able to let my mind focus on the topics I enjoy. Time seems to fly by when you are working on something you actually care for.

I planned on being in bed around midnight tonight and now its getting close to 3:30. If I stay up any longer I'll be awake when my dad leaves for work. But anyway the site finally seems to be coming together, I really like this theme I found, though I think I'll change the colors. Other than that I expect the site layout to stay pretty much the same. I may change the homepage up a bit and consult some of my friends in design to see how I could make things prettier, but for the most part I'm pretty happy with it. Hope you all enjoy this site, I plan to keep adding to it as time goes on!

p.s It's late, I didn't proof read this post, if there are spelling/grammar errors I apologize.
