## Who Am I?

  My name is Omar White, I'm currently a senior at Indiana University studying Informatics with minors in Business and Computer Science. I'm also a native of Bloomington, Indiana so I attend school in the same town I grew up in. After I graduate I'll be moving to Minneapolis, Minnesota where I'll be working with Target. I'm a huge nerd, I love all things related to tech, but I'm specifically interested in software engineering, web development, data visualization, and hacking around with Arduinos and Raspberry Pi's. When I'm not nerding out over something tech related you can probably find me listening to music or wasting time on twitter, my social media platform of choice.
